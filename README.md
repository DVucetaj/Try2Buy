# ctpProject
1) Project Name: Marketplace E-commerce Platform (Try, Rent or Buy)
2) Student Name: Janiza Gesmundo, Christopher Ferguson, Donat Vucetaj
3) Executive Summary: 
    The motivation of this application is for an online shopper to have 3 options of consuming a product found on the web. Try, rent or buy it features that combines all together to have a shopper have many options to choose from. Rent The Runway is the main competitor and inspiration for this project. But the main difference is, this application will be a marketplace where everyone can buy and sell their own or secondhand products. Similar to Ebay and Etsy, anyone is welcome to sell their products with options for shoppers to try, rent or buy it. The Try It On feature is inspired from my own experience of I want to experience the product first, before I actually want to pay for it. Try It On feature gives the shopper an option to experience the product before paying the full price. Similar to sending a free sample with no credit info required. If the shopper decides to keep it, he/she will now go back to the site to enter their credit card info. But if the shopper doesn’t like the product, there will be an agreement of he/she will only pay for the shipping fee of delivery. In my experience in the e-commerce field, there have been a lot of customer complains about how a product doesn’t satisfy a customer just because of how it was merchandised on the web. The Try It On feature is something that I haven’t heard yet in the e-commerce field/industry. There will also be a one-click login and checkout features. 
4) User-types:
    Sellers: can upload their products to sell 
    Buyers: who buys the products 
    Administrator: approves Seller’s products 
5) Use Cases/User Stories:
    As an online shopper, I want to be able to try on the product without committing to buying the full price so that I can have the chance to change my mind if I want to return or keep the product in a hassle free scenario. 
    As an indecisive online shopper, I want to be able to rent a product that I won’t be using for more than two days so that I can save money and not worry about it living in my closet and unused. 
    As an online shopper with only limited time on their hands, I want to be able to log in and checkout an online shopping site in one click or as fast as possible so that I can save time.
